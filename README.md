# Zombie Dream
Final project with a classmate Nat Ruiz in CIIT College of Arts and Technology Senior High School, Grade 12.

## What is Zombie Dream? 
It is a short **platformer-shooter game** made in **Unity Engine** from February - May 2018.

These are the raw Unity project files, Dragonbones files, including other graphics assets (sprites, character designs, level designs, etc), code, and sound effects.

Some assets were taken online from Google images or other sources. But a lot of the assets are _**original**_, and **made by me** or my classmates in CIIT.

The tools used to make the game proper were Unity Engine, Visual Studio for editing C# code, FL Studio for music, Photoshop CS6/CC and Adobe Flash CS6 for assets design, and Dragonbones for animation. There were also some Unity libraries utilized in order to use Dragonbones for character animations.
